## Architecture
This application is written on top of the MVC pattern and following SOLID principles.
The data flow between app logical layers is as following:

    Request
        ‚ÜòÔ∏è                
         Controller ‚ÜîÔ∏è Service (may use request/reponse classes to communicate)
             ‚ÜòÔ∏è
               Response/Output: in this case this is a view or a text response (case of commands).
               This output may need data transformers in case to be API data response

Although request or response classes are used in the services, 
a real communication bus is not being implemented. 
This can be implemented with [messenger](https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html).
